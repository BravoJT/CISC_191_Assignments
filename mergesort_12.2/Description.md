# **Merge Sorter**
The class [MergeSort](src/MergeSort.java) generates an array of six random integers, and sorts them in ascending order using the Merge Sort method. It also keeps tally of how many times the program makes a comparison, and when it makes a successful swap. 
>[!NOTE]
>Successful swaps are also counted in the comparisons total.

>[!WARNING]
>The test example for this assignment didn't give a number for the swap count, so the swap counter may not be accurate.
# **Challenges**
My brain really struggles with implementing the merge sort method, I mainly just tried to learn by following the example in the lecture file and drilling what each part is doing in my head. Getting the number of comparisons and swaps was mechanically easy, though the swap count may be messed up for all I know.
