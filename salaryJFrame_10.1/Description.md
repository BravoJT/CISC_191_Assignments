# **Salary Calculator Lab**
This lab consists of the [SalaryCalc](src/SalaryCalc.java) class, and its intended function is to get user-inputted hours/wages and give the user a yearly salary. The purpose of this is to learn about JFrame functionality and GUI design.

# **Challenges**
I've never used JFrame very much, my main experience in that field is with LibGDX when I made my game in high school. I've gotten stuck at some points, like when I tried resizing the text box, or when the labels randomly decided not to stack vertically after more than two were added.
