# **Mile Converter Lab**
This lab consists of the [MilesToKilos](src/MilesToKilos.java) class, and its intended function is to get a int number of miles from the user using an incrementer/decrementer, and display equivalent distance in kilometers. The purpose of this lab is to show us the basics of the JSpinner with dealing in integer values.

# **Challenges**
This lab was somewhat easier than the other two labs, between what I did in those and looking at the DogYearsFrame example given in the lecture. I had a bit of a head start on the JSpinner, as I tried to use it in 10.1 before I read the directions better and knew I couldn't use that.
