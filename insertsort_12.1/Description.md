# **Insertion Sorter**
The class [InsertSort](src/InsertSort.java) generates an array of six random integers, and sorts them in ascending order using the Insertion Sorting method. It also keeps tally of how many times the program makes a comparison, and when it makes a successful swap. It also returns the sorted array, though this is not utilized in my tests. 
>[!NOTE]
>Successful swaps are also counted in the comparisons total.
# **Challenges**
The insertion sort itself wasn't too tough, I've done it before in my high school class. The part I mainly had to work out was figuring out what to count as a comparison or swap. Went through a few quick variants with the example array until I got a match that seemed to make sense.
