# **Automotive Database Interface**
The [AutoInterface](src/AutoInterface.java) class' function is to read in a text file called [auto-mpg.txt](auto-mpg.txt), use SQL statements to upload said data to a preexisting database, and open a window for a user to view said data. In this GUI, the user can enter name, mpg, and horsepower values to search through the table. When the user enters "all" into the name text box, the entire table is printed, and the hp/mpg sliders use '0' as an "ignore" value when searching. 
# **Challenges**
This one was certainly a lot more challenging than the other labs.
